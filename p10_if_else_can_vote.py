# A person can vote if their age is greater than or equal to 18.
# Ask the user for their age with the prompt 'Enter your age: ' inside
# int(input()). If the user's age is 18 or more, print 'You can vote'
# Otherwise, print 'You cannot vote'
# You need to use an if statement with an else.

# DO NOT USE TWO IF STATEMENTS. Use an if + else. If you use two if statements
# I will deduct points even if your code passes the tests.
