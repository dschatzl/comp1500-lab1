# One pizza costs $12. Ask the user how many pizzas they want with the prompt
# 'Enter number of pizzas: ' inside of int(input()) (see the previous question
# if you are confused about how to do this).
# Multiply the value that the user enters by 12 to get their total price,
# and store their total in a variable named total_price.
# Print their total cost to them beginning with 'Your total is $'
# For example: if the user says they want 3 pizzas, your program should print
#'Your total is $36'
