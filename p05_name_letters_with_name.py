# Use the input() function to ask the user for their name with the prompt:
# 'Enter your name: '

# Use the len() function to determine the length of the users name.
# Print out a message to the user with the number of letters in their name.
# The message should be their name, followed by 'has', followed by the count, and end with 'letters'
# For example, if the user says that their name is "mimir" then your program
# should print 'mimir has 5 letters'

# Note that this is the same as the previous problem except that instead of
# printing 'Your name' you must print out the name that the user entered.
