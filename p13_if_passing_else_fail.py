# A grade is passing if it is greater than or equal to 65
# Ask a user to enter their grade with the prompt 'Enter your grade: ' inside
# int(input()). If the user's grade is 65 or more, print 'You passed'
# Otherwise, print 'You failed'
# You need to use an if statement with an else.

# DO NOT USE TWO IF STATEMENTS. Use an if + else. If you use two if statements
# I will deduct points even if your code passes the tests.
