# We same a name is short if it is 3 characters or fewer. Ask the user for
# their name with the prompt 'Enter your name: '
# If the len() of the user' name is less than 4, print the user's name,
# followed  by 'is a short name'
# Otherwise, print the user's name, followed by 'is not a short name'

# DO NOT USE TWO IF STATEMENTS. Use an if + else. If you use two if statements
# I will deduct points even if your code passes the tests.

# For example:
# Enter your name: al
# al is a short name

# Another example:
# Enter your name: jackie
# jackie is not a short name
