# A person can vote if their age is greater than or equal to 18.
# Ask the user for their age with the prompt 'Enter your age: ' inside
# int(input()). If the user's age is 18 or more, print 'You can vote'

# Otherwise subtract the users age from 18 and tell them how much longer until
# they can vote, print 'You can vote in', followed by the years remanining,
# followed by 'years'
# You need to use an if statement with an else.

# For example: if a user says their age is 15, your code should show this:
# Enter your age: 15
# You can vote in 3 years
