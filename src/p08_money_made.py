# Your user works in sales. The user will tell you how much money they make per
# item, and how many items they sold. Use this information to calculate, and
# display the total amount they made by multiplying the two together.
# Use the prompts 'Enter amount per item: ' and 'Enter number of items sold: '
# in that order, then display 'You made $' followed by the amount made.
#
# An example run of the program with $5 per item and 8 items sold would look
# like this:
#
# Enter amount per item: 5
# Enter number of items sold: 8
# You made $40
